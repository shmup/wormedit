worms 3.8 added a hidden resolution scaling setting to the registry.

note: the initial worms frontend fixes scaling via wkSuperFrontend.

note: this does not work with OpeNGL, Direct3D 9 recommended, DirectDraw works
      though mouse can goof when moving camera while doing actions.

Display size is the resolution the game will run at:
  
  note: this is also configurable in Options > Graphics

  - DisplayXSize
  - DisplayYSize 

Window size is the resolution the game will upscale to:

  - WindowXSize
  - WindowYSize
  - to play in borderless-windows, set these to your monitor resolution



I suppose for the UI I want to remove our extra title at the top, it's already in the title bar

I want to remove the blue "Current internal" scale stuff.
